# face-detection-and-recognition
Here in this code I have shown how to built a face recogniton system using opencv and face_recognition module using few lines of code, I will perform all the steps from data collection to its final output via image encoding and face location techniques. I have tried to recognize the face of a person (Hrithik Roshan) given its training image and an another image of Ratan_tata after that I compared the two different images of a same person (Hrithik Roshan 1 and Hrithik Roshan 2) and the two images with completely different persons (Hrithik Roshan 1 and Ratan Tata). What I found is that my model was recognising Hrithik Roshan preety well and was able to differenciate between two completely different images based on 'face distance' metric.

Rest of the information you can find in my code, I have explained everything there.
